# Cybersecurity Portfolio
My cybersecurity portfolio to showcase my skills as I practice to becoming a cybersecurity professional.

**Professional Statement**:
		Being someone who is organized and has a willingness to learn, I can support the security goals of various organizations that strive to maintain the safety of their organization through the understanding and use of organized systems in a field that is constantly adapting and requires staying updated and learning about new information on systems, methods, and so on.  I highly value adhering to rules and procedures in order to thoroughly protect and inform others, such as an organization and the people they support.
